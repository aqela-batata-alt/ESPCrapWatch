**The world's most unreliable smartwatch** - because i want

## Overview

The ESP-based Smart Crap Watch is a feature-packed (with mostly useless features) wearable device built on the ESP32 platform using ESP-IDF. It promises to deliver all the functionality you probably don't need in a smartwatch.

This repository contains everything you need to build your own questionable wearable technology, from the firmware to the hardware design.

## Features

- **Clock**: Displays time.
- **Binary Clock**: Displays time in binary, 'cause why not?.
- **Great Battery Life**: Very optimized battery usage.
- **Notification Support**: Get notified about notifications about notifications
- **Interactive and customizable UI**: support for custom UI.
- **Easy controlls**: Two and one buttons needed for navigation.
- **Bad Apple**: Native Bad Apple player with decoder.
- **Other**: To be added :3.

## Hardware Requirements

### Components
- ESP32 t-display ( like the one for ttgo or lilygo), TS-ESP32-S3 or you can get a default one and add your own screen if you want to.
- LiPo battery ( at least more than 500mAh for longer battery health).
- Vibrating motor ( optional).

## Warning

- Make sure the battery is not contacting your skin directly to avoid slow skin burn.
- Make sure the battery is not contacting the processor of the board to avoid heat damage and explosions.
- Avoid **at all costs** the contact of the watch with water.

We are not responsible for any damage you or your hardware may have. **Build at your own risk!**
