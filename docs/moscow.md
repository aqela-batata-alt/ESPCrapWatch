# MoSCoW Prioritization - CrapWatch Project

The following prioritization uses the MoSCoW technique, categorizing each User Story according to its importance and impact on the product.

---

## Must Have (Essential – without these, the product fails its purpose as a watch)

- **US #1 – Show time**  
  Displaying the current time is the core function of any watch.  

- **US #5 – Battery life**  
  Without minimum autonomy, the device becomes impractical.  

- **US #13 – Alarm**  
  A key feature for any smart or digital watch.  

---

## Should Have (Important – add strong value, but not absolutely critical)

- **US #2 – Set Timer**  
  Useful in everyday scenarios.  

- **US #7 – Resettable Stopwatch**  
  A common expectation in watches, especially for athletes.  

---

## Could Have (Nice to have – interesting differentials, but non-critical)

- **US #3 – Show time in binary**  
  Niche but fun feature for geeky users.  

- **US #6 – WiFi based IoT**  
  Adds IoT control but not essential for the core product.  

- **US #8 – ESPNOW based IoT**  
  Complements US #6, more specific use case.  

- **US #9 – Customizable Watch Themes**  
  Improves aesthetics, not essential.  

- **US #10 – Animations**  
  Adds personality to the interface, but not critical.  

- **US #11 – Dice Roller**  
  Fun, niche functionality for tabletop gamers.  

---

## Won’t Have (Out of initial scope – too complex or not aligned with MVP)

- **US #4 – Play Bad Apple**  
  Highly specific and with little practical value.  

- **US #12 – Built-in AI**  
  Too ambitious for the device’s initial scope.  

- **US #14 – >Name<**  
  Incomplete/ambiguous, not prioritized until properly defined.
